The program couldn't be executed, but I think I wrote the 
codes right.
I just want to show that I tried to do this program convenient
for the OOP Basics. (Inheritance, Abstraction, Template vs.)
For instance;
As you see, when I write int as a type, compiler know that
and change 'E' into int (Photo 1.jpg); 
and then when I write char as a type, compiler know that 
and change 'E' into char (Photo 2.Jpg)

Besides, I put the uml diagram of the program in the file.
